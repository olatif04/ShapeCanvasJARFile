# ShapeCanvas

This project was made for the COMP-3220 course at the Univwrsity of Windsor.
## Overview
ShapeCanvas is a Java application that showcases the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create a dynamic simulation of geometric shapes. This project demonstrates inheritance, abstraction, and composition through the creation and management of shapes such as rectangles, squares, ovals, and circles on a virtual canvas.

## Features

- **OOP Principles**: Utilizes inheritance for shape relationships, abstraction for the shape concept, and composition for incorporating a canvas with multiple shapes.
- **Shape Hierarchy**: Implements a hierarchy of geometric shapes, including rectangles, squares, ovals, and circles.
- **Dynamic Canvas**: Generates a canvas populated with 10 unique, randomly sized shapes, ensuring no duplicates.
- **Unique Shape IDs**: Assigns a unique identifier to each shape, demonstrating static variable usage.
